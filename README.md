### Step 2:

Open [Skype To Jabber Exporter](https://newb23.github.io/Skype-Contacts-To-Jabber-Extractor/) in any browser

### Step 3

Enter the group name and paste the copied group contacts into the contacts field, then click Add (Repeat this step for each group)

### Step 4:

When you finish adding your groups you can copy the generated XML yourself and save to a .xml file locally, or click Export to download an XML file named "SkypeContacts.xml" with your converted groups and contacts

### Step 5:

Open Jabber and login with your account, open the importer, choose the xml file we created or downloaded, then click import
