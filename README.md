## Why?

Skype for Business does not allow users to easily export contact groups for import into Cisco Jabber.

## How To Use

You just need to follow these simple steps:

### Step 1:

Right click on your Skype group header and click Copy

### Step 3

Enter the group name and paste the copied group contacts in the contacts field, then click Add (Repeat this step for each group)

### Step 4:

When you finish adding your groups you can copy the generated XML yourself or click Export to download an XML file named "SkypeContacts.xml" with your converted groups and contacts

### Step 5:

Open Jabber and login with your account, then open the importer and choose the xml file we created and downloaded, then click import
